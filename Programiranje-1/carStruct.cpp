    Create a two-dimensional dynamic array whose elements are Car objects.
    Allow the user to enter array dimensions. 
    
    Create following function:
    路 Function to input car features - some function receives a pointer to a car.
        It is mandatory to automate the entry so that random values are entered in all numerical characteristics.
        The task will not be considered correct if this is not done.
    路 Function for printing a complete 2D sequence with all the characteristics of all cars,
    路 Assume that the rows represent the companies and the columns represent the cars in the company.
    路 Find the index of the company with the lowest average car consumption.


    In this task, it is forbidden to index array elements with square brackets.
    Must use pointer arithmetic
